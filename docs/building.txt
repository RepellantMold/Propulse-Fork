Propulse Tracker build instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

- FreePascal 3.0+: http://www.freepascal.org/
- Lazarus: http://www.lazarus-ide.org/ (or CodeTyphon)

The following headers are contained in the src/include directory:

 Required:

 - SDL2: http://libsdl.org/ 

 Optional (but strongly recommended):

 - used to load SDL2 dynamically: https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazsdl2/
 - BASS: http://www.un4seen.com/ (required for mp3/ogg/other sample import)
 - libSOXR for resampling: https://sourceforge.net/p/soxr/wiki/Home/
 - Generics.Collections for FreePascal, if using an old version where they are
   not included by default: https://github.com/dathox/generics.collections

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building on Windows:

- Install FreePascal 3.x and Lazarus
- Open Propulse.lps in Lazarus or Propulse.ctpr in CodeTyphon
- Open propulse.inc and modify options if required
- Press Shift-F9 to build
- Probably complain to me if it didn't work

Building on Linux:

- Install SDL2 development packages
- Download the "stuff" Linux build of BASS (the official 2.4.12 Linux build
  has a crash bug on some systems, including mine):
  http://www.un4seen.com/stuff/bass-linux.zip
- Extract the appropriate libbass.so into the project's root dir (not src!)
- Follow the above instructions for building on Windows

Building on Mac (courtesy of @nilsding):

- Install the Xcode command-line tools
- Install SDL2 from Homebrew: brew install sdl2
- Copy /usr/local/lib/libSDL2.dylib to the project's root directory (Propulse
  will not run otherwise)
- Download BASS for macOS from http://www.un4seen.com/ and copy libbass.dylib
  into the project's root directory
- Append this line to your /etc/fpc.cfg if you are running 10.14 (Mojave) or
  newer: -XR/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
- Follow the above instructions for building on Windows
