Propulse Tracker build instructions
===================================

Windows:

- Install FreePascal 3.x and Lazarus
- Open Propulse.lps in Lazarus
- Press Shift-F9 to build

Linux:

- Install SDL2 development packages (2.0.5 or newer)
- Download the "stuff" Linux build of BASS (the official 2.4.12 Linux build
  has a crash bug on some systems, including mine):
  http://www.un4seen.com/stuff/bass-linux.zip
- Extract the appropriate libbass.so into the project's root directory 
  (not src!)
- Follow the above instructions for building on Windows

Mac:

  No idea for now, sorry; the source may need some additional work to
  build/run on a Mac.
