Propulse Tracker current status
===============================

- Some mouse and keyboard input issues due to change from Delphi's form event
  based input handling to SDL2
- Some graphical glitches may exist due to changes to graphics API
- libSOXR support is not implemented yet on non-Windows platforms
- Program tries to load/save config and data files from the executable's
  path instead of a sane location for the current OS; this needs fixing
- No splash screen yet
- Render to wav is not functional yet
- Mac support needs someone to work on, I don't have access to one

Regressions/changes from PoroTracker 0.8.9.3
============================================

- Settings for audio API and graphics rendering API removed
- Setting "use OS file requesters" removed
- Setting "task priority" only available on Windows
- Window scaling (pixel doubling) is changed via settings instead of simply
  resizing the window
- Font file must be a 256-color PCX for now
