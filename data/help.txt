@Configuration
[  Configuration  
§
§ (* An asterisk indicates that Propulse Tracker needs to be restarted for
§    changes to this setting to take effect.)

* Audio settings
§
# Audio device: *
§ The audio device to be used.
§
# Sampling rate: *
§ Sets the desired sampling rate for the audio device, from 11 to 48 KHz.
§
# Audio buffer: *
§ This is the audio buffer size in milliseconds. Too low values will cause
§ dropouts and crackling, while large values increase audio latency.
§ Defaults to the minimum recommended length for the selected audio device.
§
# Amplification:
§ Sets the amplification level for the internal mixer of the module player
§ engine. Too large values cause clipping, while too low values decrease the
§ dynamic range of the audio output. Default: 6.00. During playback the VU
§ meter in the pattern editor screen will flash red to indicate that clipping
§ occurred.
§
# Stereo separation:
§ The percentage of stereo separation to apply. Real Amigas have 100% stereo
§ separation, but a smaller amount is much more headphone friendly.
§
# Lowpass filter:
§ Propulse Tracker emulates the Amiga's lowpass filter. This setting specifies
§ whether to set the filter on by default.
§
# Highpass filter:
§ Amigas also contain a slight highpass filter, which can be enabled here.
§
| LED filter:
|
# Timing mode:
§ Works like the CIA/VBL setting in original ProTracker; best left at CIA.
§
# Play EFX (Invert Loop) like:
§ The Invert Loop effect plays differently in the ProTracker editor as opposed
§ to other programs that use the ProTracker module playback routines. You can
§ choose either playback behavior here.
§

* Display settings
§
# Maximum scale factor:
§ Sets the largest wanted pixel scaling ratio for windowed mode. For example,
§ set to 2 for a double-size window, unless that size would exceed the monitor
§ resolution.
§
# Font:
§ Changes the font used.
§
# Mouse pointer:
§ Change between the system default mouse pointer, a custom mouse sprite as
§ specified in mouse.pcx (or mouse2.pcx for large fonts), or none altogether.
§
# Show sample sizes/offsets in:
# Show sizes/offsets as:
§ These control how various numeric size and offset information is displayed.
§ Sample sizes can be shown as either bytes and words, in either decimal or
§ hexadecimal.
§
# Show filesizes as:
§ Choose whether load/save module/sample dialogs should display file sizes as
§ bytes (like "10752") or kilobytes (like "10.5K").
§
# Splash screen: *
§ Determines whether to show the About screen at startup or to skip it and
§ jump straight to the pattern editor.
§

* Editor settings
§
# Effect commands:
§ Choose if you want to use ProTracker or Impulse Tracker commands when
§ tracking. For example, volume fade is Axx in PT and Dxx in IT. This
§ setting only affects display and editing, not file saving.
§
# Home and End keys behavior:
§ Affects navigation in the pattern editor; either the traditional style or
§ Propulse Tracker's own method.
§
# Show empty command parameters as:
§ Optionally hides the trailing zeroes in empty effect slots.
§
# Consider note B-3 as invalid:
§ Notes played at B-3 may sound odd on real Amigas; while Propulse Tracker does
§ not emulate this behavior (nor does any other PC replayer that I know of),
§ you can at least choose to colorize the notes differently.
§

* Program settings
§
# Task priority: (Windows only)
§ You can choose to give a higher processing priority to PoroTracker to
§ lessen the chance of audio dropouts. (On by default)
§

* Resampling settings
§
§ TBD
§

* Key bindings
§
§ You can redefine most key bindings in PoroTracker to suit your needs.
§

* Color palette
§
§ Modify the color palette to your liking and optionally change which colors
§ are used to draw various parts of the user interface. Color settings can
§ be also saved as presets.
