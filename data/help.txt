@Configuration
[  Configuration  
§
§ (* An asterisk indicates that PoroTracker needs to be restarted for
§    changes to this setting to take effect.)

* Audio settings
§
# Audio driver: *
§ Choose between DirectSound (default) or two WASAPI modes.
§ WASAPI is a more modern audio API supported from Windows Vista onwards and
§ may allow a smaller audio buffer to be used. Note that the WASAPI
§ implementation in PoroTracker is not completely finished yet.
§
# Audio device: *
§ The device index of the audio device to be used. Uses the system default
§ audio device by default.
§
# Sampling rate: *
§ Sets the audio device sampling rate.
§
# Audio buffer: *
§ This is the audio buffer size in milliseconds. Too low values will cause
§ dropouts and crackling, while large values increase audio latency.
§ Defaults to the minimum recommended length for the audio device.
§
# Amplification:
§ Sets the amplification level for the internal mixer of the module player
§ engine. Too large values cause clipping, while too low values decrease the
§ dynamic range of the audio output. Default: 6.00. During playback the VU
§ meter in the pattern editor screen will flash red to indicate that clipping
§ occurred.
§
# Stereo separation:
§ The percentage of stereo separation to apply. Real Amigas have 100% stereo
§ separation, but a smaller amount is much more headphone friendly.
§
# Lowpass filter:
§ PoroTracker emulates the Amiga's lowpass filter. This setting specifies
§ whether to set the filter on by default.
§
# Highpass filter:
§ Amigas also contain a slight highpass filter, which can be enabled here.
§
# LED filter:
§
# Timing mode:
§ Works like the CIA/VBL setting in original ProTracker; best left at CIA.
§
# Play EFX (Invert Loop) like:
§ The Invert Loop effect plays differently in the ProTracker editor as opposed
§ to other programs that use the ProTracker module playback routines. You can
§ choose either playback behavior here.
§

* Display settings
§
# Display driver: *
§ Choose between Direct2D or OpenGL accelerated graphics. Direct2D may work
§ slightly faster and better but requires a patched Windows Vista at minimum.
§
# Font:
§ Changes the font used.
§
# Mouse pointer:
§ Change between the system default mouse pointer, a custom mouse sprite as
§ specified in mouse.bmp, or none altogether.
§
# Show sizes/offsets as:
# Show sample sizes/offsets in:
§ These control how various numeric size and offset information is displayed.
§ Sample sizes can be shown as either bytes and words, in either decimal or
§ hexadecimal.
§
# Splash screen: *
§ Determines whether to show the About screen at startup or jump straight to
§ the pattern editor.
§

* Editor settings
§
# Effect commands:
§ Choose if you want to use ProTracker or Impulse Tracker commands when
§ tracking. For example, volume fade is Axx in PT and Dxx in IT. This
§ setting only affects display and editing, not file saving.
§
# Home and End keys behavior:
§ Affects navigation in the pattern editor; either the traditional style or
§ PoroTracker's own method.
§
# Show empty command parameters as:
§ Optionally hides the trailing zeroes in empty effect slots.
§
# Consider note B-3 as invalid:
§ Notes played at B-3 may sound odd on real Amigas; while PoroTracker doesn't
§ emulate this behavior (nor does any other PC replayer that I know of), you
§ can at least choose to colorize the notes differently.
§

* Program settings
§
# Task priority:
§ You can choose to give a higher processing priority to PoroTracker to
§ lessen the chance of audio dropouts. (On by default)
§
# File requesters to use:
§ You can use standard Windows file requesters for all file operations.
§

* Resampling settings
§
§ TBD
§

* Key bindings
§
§ You can redefine most key bindings in PoroTracker to suit your needs.
§

* Color palette
§
§ Modify the color palette to your liking and optionally change which colors
§ are used to draw various parts of the user interface. Color settings can
§ be also saved as presets.
